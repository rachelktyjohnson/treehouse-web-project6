# Treehouse WebDev Project 6
## Data Pagination and Filtering

In this project, you'll use a common web development technique known as "pagination" to enhance a web page's usability.

You'll start with a file that contains information for 42 students, including name, email, and picture. You'll begin by using your JavaScript skills to display the first nine students on the page. Then you will add navigation, also known as pagination buttons, that the user can click to display different pages of students.

Your application will need to work with a list of any number of students, not just with the supplied array of 42 students. This means your solutions need to be flexible enough to handle arrays of student data of various lengths.
